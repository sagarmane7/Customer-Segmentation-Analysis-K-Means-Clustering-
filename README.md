Internship: Oasis Infobyte

Domain: Data Analytics

Project: Customer Segmentation using K-Means

🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing and spending behavior using K-Means Clustering.
This segmentation helps businesses understand different customer types and design targeted marketing strategies.

🧠 Key Steps

Data Cleaning & Exploration – Checked data types, missing values, and removed duplicates.

Feature Engineering – Created a new feature TotalSpending combining product spending columns.

Feature Scaling – Standardized features using StandardScaler for fair clustering.

K-Means Clustering – Applied clustering with 4 segments to group similar customers.

Visualization – Used scatter plots and bar charts to interpret segment patterns.

Segment Profiling – Derived behavioral insights for each customer segment.

📊 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler)
Google Colab

💡 Key Insights
